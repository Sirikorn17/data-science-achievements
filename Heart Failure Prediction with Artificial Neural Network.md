# Heart Failure Prediction with Artificial Neural Network

**Date:** Oct 2023  
This project aims to predict the occurrence of heart failure using medical data and an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model. The study analyzed health factors such as age, sex, cholesterol, chest pain type, blood pressure, fasting blood sugar, ECG results, maximum heart rate, and exercise angina to identify the most influential predictors of heart failure.  
The model achieved **85.87% accuracy**, **90.01% recall**, and **85.05% precision**, showing potential for early diagnosis and healthcare planning.

**Award:** 3rd Place Winner *(1st Symposium on Data Science â€” SDS 2023)*
