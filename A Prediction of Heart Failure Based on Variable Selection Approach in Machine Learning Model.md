## A Prediction of Heart Failure Based on Variable Selection Approach
**Date:** Feb 2025  
This research focuses on the study of heart failure, a condition of great significance due to its high prevalence worldwide and its role as a major cause of mortality in Thailand, with an increasing trend each year. The study aims to examine factors contributing to heart failure by analyzing three models including XGBoost, CatBoost and LightGBM. The goal is to compare the performance of these models and identify the most suitable one. This comparison will help assess the models' effectiveness in predicting heart failure. The findings will provide valuable information for improving health care plans and reducing risks in high-risk populations. The results revealed that the CatBoost model was the most appropriate, with an accuracy of 88.59%.
