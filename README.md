## Heart Failure Prediction with Artificial Neural Network
**Date:** Oct 2023  
**Description:**  
This research studied heart failure prediction based on key health factors by using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model with medical data. The process included cleaning and analyzing the data, training the model, and evaluating its performance. The model achieved about **85.87% accuracy** and explored the relationships between key health factors and heart disease.

## A Prediction of Heart Failure Based on Variable Selection Approach
**Date:** Feb 2025  
This research studied heart failure prediction based on key health factors by comparing three machine learning models including XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost, using medical data. Stepwise Selection with VIF and correlation analysis was applied to identify the most significant predictors, followed by EDA to assess the impact of each health factor on heart failure risk. The models were evaluated using K-Fold Cross Validation and an 80/20 train-test split. CatBoost achieved the best performance with an **accuracy of 88.59%**, precision of 91.35%, recall of 88.72% and F1-score of 90.05%.

## Comparison of Loan Approval Prediction Models
**Date:** Mar 2024  
This research studied loan approval prediction by comparing four machine learning models including Random Forest, LightGBM, CatBoost, and XGBoost. Stepwise Selection was applied to identify the most significant variables affecting loan approval, followed by EDA to assess how each variable influences the loan approval status. The models were evaluated using an 80/20 train-test split, and LightGBM achieved the best performance with an **accuracy of 99.06%**, precision of 99.36%, recall of 98.11%, and an F1-score of 98.73%. 

**Award:** Outstanding Poster Presentation *(13th Undergraduate Applied Mathematics Conference — UAMC 2025)*
