## Heart Failure Prediction Model Using Machine Learning
**Date:** Mar 2024  
This research focuses on studying the condition of heart failure, which is highly significant due to its common occurrence and the large number of patients worldwide. It is also a major cause of significant mortality in Thailand, with a rising trend each year. The objective is to investigate factors influencing the occurrence of heart failure, analyzing the problem to implement measures that can reduce the risk. Three models, namely Artificial Neural Network, Na√Øve Bayes, and Random Forest, were employed to compare their effectiveness. The goal is to select the most suitable model, providing insights into the predictive performance of each model in anticipating heart failure. The analysis results reveal that the Artificial Neural Network model is the most suitable, achieving an accuracy rate of up to 85.87%
