## Comparison of Loan Approval Prediction Models
**Date:** Mar 2024  
The primary objective of this study is to develop the most suitable model for predicting loan approval using machine learning techniques. The goal is to enhance the efficiency of loan applicant screening and reduce the risk of granting loans that may not be repaid.
This study utilizes a dataset of 4,269 records and applies four machine learning models—Random Forest, LightGBM, CatBoost, and XGBoost—to compare their performance and identify the most accurate model for loan approval prediction. Additionally, the Stepwise Selection method is employed to select the most influential variables affecting loan approval, reducing model complexity and improving analytical accuracy.
The results indicate that the LightGBM model performs the best, achieving an accuracy of 99.06%, precision of 99.36%, recall of 98.11%, and an F1-score of 98.73%. Compared to the other models, these findings suggest that LightGBM is the most suitable choice for predicting loan approval.
The insights from this study can be utilized to enhance the accuracy of loan approval processes, reduce the rate of non-performing loans, and enable financial institutions to manage risks more effectively. Furthermore, future research may incorporate Deep Learning techniques to further improve predictive performance, enhance analysis, and minimize errors in assessing applicants’ credit risk.
